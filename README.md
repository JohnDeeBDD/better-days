# Better Days Theme

This repository contains a custom, one-off WordPress theme created for a private client project.

The theme was built for **Better Days for Seniors**, a business run by **Trish Karlynski** through her consultancy. It is tailored specifically to this client’s branding, content structure, and business needs rather than intended for general distribution.

## Project type

- Custom WordPress theme
- One-off/private client implementation
- Business website theme focused on services for seniors

## Notes

This is a bespoke project and not a reusable/public theme package.
